# Swift Network Connectivity

This is a simple network manager wrapper that uses the [IJReachability](https://github.com/Isuru-Nanayakkara/IJReachability) class to test for network availability.

# Usage
Import the Manager into your project. Declare a new instance of the NetworkManager and call the function `startNetworkMonitor`.
